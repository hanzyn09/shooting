# shooting
target shooter with webGL.
Five asteroids are randomly placed per game.
If the asteroid is hit with a laser, you get 100 points.
You don't shoot until you get out of the screen, HP is deducted by 1.
If you shoot down all set asteroids, you accumulate points and move on to the next level to create a new environment.
The higher the level, the more asteroids there are.
