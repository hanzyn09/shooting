# shooting
Target shooter with webGL (javascript, css, jquery with THREE.js and require.js). </br>

<b>[concept]</b></br>
If the user fails to hit the asteroid, the asteroid falls on the earth.</br>

<b>[Game Setting]</b></br>
Five asteroids are randomly placed per game. </br>
If the asteroid is hit with a laser, you get 100 points. </br>
You don't shoot until you get out of the screen, and HP is deducted by 1. </br>
If you shoot down all set asteroids, you accumulate points and move on to the next level to create a new environment.</br>
The higher the level, the more asteroids there are. </br>
